            <h3>Saffron Rice</h3>
            <p>
              Saffron is often called the "gold of spices" and for good reason. Its unique flavor profile and vibrant color can transform even the simplest dishes into gourmet experiences. Rumi Spice saffron is sourced directly from Afghan farmers, ensuring the highest quality. Each thread is handpicked and dried with care by Afghan women, capturing the essence of this remarkable spice. 

Easy Saffron Rice is the Best Recipe to Try Saffron
This Easy Saffron Rice recipe is designed to highlight the delicate, savory flavor of saffron without overwhelming it with too many other ingredients. The combination of basmati rice and chicken stock creates a rich, aromatic base that complements the saffron perfectly. And if you’re vegetarian, you can easily swap the chicken stock for vegetable stock or bouillon.

            <h3>Tandoori Chicken</h3>
            <p>
              Tandoori tastes spicy and flavorful, with a slightly smoky taste due to the high heat of the tandoor. The spices used in tandoori dishes, such as cumin, coriander, garam masala, and turmeric, give them a warm, aromatic flavor.
              In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the Tandoori Masala spice mix, olive oil and lemon juice. Add in your chicken and toss until well coated on all sides.
For more tender and flavorful meat, cover the bowl and marinate the meat for at least 15 minutes, up to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Place the chicken on a baking sheet in a single layer. Transfer to the oven and roast for about 40 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
Increase the oven temperature to broil and broil on the upper oven rack until the chicken skin is a deep golden red and crispy.
Let cool slightly before serving with fresh lemon wedges and chopped parsley.

            <h3>Spiced Saffron Latte</h3>
            <p>
Inspired by the flavors of the Middle East and the North African region, a cup of cinnamon saffron coffee will transport you to another world. The warm spice of the cinnamon compliments the floral notes and inherent sweetness of the saffron threads to make both an indulgent and sweet start to your morning. Pair it with a simple pastry and you’ve got a breakfast that will satisfy into the afternoon.
For 4 servings, simply combine 1 ounce of your favorite ground coffee,  2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon, and 1 large pinch of Afghan saffron into your coffee filter. Add 4 cups of water to your coffee maker’s reservoir. Brew as usual. Once done, pour into your mug and sweeten as desired. We love sweetening with a drizzle of raw organic honey.
